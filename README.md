# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for MECH105 numerical methods.
## Algorithms
1. False Position
  It used the false position method to find the roots of an equation.
3. Linear Algebra 
  It used LU decomposition to solve systems.
5. Simpson's 1/3 Rule
  Used the Simpson's 1/3 rule to find the integral of an equation.
