# MECH105-Algorithms
This repository holds all the algorithms I made in my time in MECH105 numerical methods.
## Algorithms
1. False Position - It used the false position method to find the roots of an equation.
3. Linear Algebra - It used LU decomposition to solve systems.
5. Simpson's 1/3 Rule - Used the Simpson's 1/3 rule to find the integral of an equation.
